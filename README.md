# Build AI Agents with n8n and Guided Mind AI

Welcome to the **n8n + Guided Mind RAG** integration series.

This repository contains a step-by-step guide to building intelligent, autonomous AI agents using [n8n](https://n8n.io/) for workflow automation and [Guided Mind AI](https://guidedmind.ai/) for the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) "brain."

## 🎯 Goal
By following these steps, you will move from a simple chatbot that answers questions based on your documents to a fully functional agent capable of taking actions (sending emails, updating CRMs) based on that knowledge.

## 🛠 Prerequisites
Before running any of the workflows in this folder, ensure you have:

1.  **n8n Instance:** A self-hosted or cloud version of n8n (Version 1.0+ recommended).
2.  **Guided Mind Account:** You need an active project with documents uploaded.
3.  **API Key:** Your Guided Mind API Key and Project ID.

## 📚 Roadmap

| Step | Status | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[Step 1: Simple Retrieval](./step-1-retrieval)** | ✅ Ready | Connect n8n to Guided Mind. The "Listening & Thinking" phase. |
| **Step 2: Action** | 🚧 Soon | Making the agent act on information (Email/Slack integration). |
| **Step 3: Decision Logic** | 🚧 Soon | Routing queries: General chat vs. Actionable requests. |
